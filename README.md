Unlocking Insights from Airbnb Data Analysis 🏠📊
I recently conducted an analysis of an Airbnb dataset, uncovering valuable insights into pricing trends and guest reviews. Here's a summary of my key findings:

Average Monthly Rent by Room Type: Significant variations were observed in the average monthly rent between different room types. Entire homes/apartments and private rooms tend to have higher rents compared to shared rooms.

Relationship between Minimum Nights and Price: A positive relationship was identified between the minimum nights required for a stay and the price. Prices generally increase with longer minimum stay requirements.

Neighbourhood Popularity: Certain neighbourhoods stood out with higher average guest reviews, indicating greater popularity or more positive reviews for listings in those areas.

These insights can be valuable for both guests and hosts on Airbnb. Guests can use this information to find accommodations that offer the best value, while hosts can adjust their pricing strategies and amenities to attract more guests.
