# README: Airbnb Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Airbnb listings data using Python. The Jupyter Notebook includes data exploration, visualization, and insights generation to understand various aspects of Airbnb properties.

## Dataset
- The dataset used is `listings.csv`, which contains details about Airbnb properties.
- The data includes information on property type, price, location, availability, and other relevant features.

## Requirements
To run this analysis, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install missing dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Key Steps in Analysis
1. **Data Loading:**
   - Reads the `listings.csv` file into a DataFrame.
   - Displays basic information such as shape, column names, and data types.

2. **Data Exploration:**
   - Summarizes numerical columns.
   - Identifies missing values and handles them appropriately.

3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Uses histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to visualize trends in pricing and availability.

4. **Insights & Conclusions:**
   - Derives insights based on location, price variations, and other key factors.

## Usage
- Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Airbnb_electro_pi.ipynb`).
- Run the cells step by step to explore the data and visualizations.
